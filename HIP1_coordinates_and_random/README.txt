Genomic coordinates for HIP1-like (HIP1+HIP1*) and random motifs
--------------------------------------------------------------------


In directory HIP1_from_50_HIP1_rich_genomes/ You can find the cooridnates for 
HIP1-like(HIP1+HIP1*) motif, for all 50 HIP1 riched genomes


[Filename convention]

File names are in the form of this:

Anabaena_90_uid179383.coordinates.HIP1_and_HIP1mis1

or 

Anabaena_90_uid179383.coordinates.HIP1_and_HIP1mis1.random


[Within the txt files]

In the data files for non-random coordinates, there is only 1 line. It is the array of coordinates.
They are sorted in ascending order.
The first element of that array is the CHROMOSOME SIZE.

In the data files for the andom coordinates, there are 200 lines of randomized coordinates array.
They are sorted within each line
The first element of each array is always the CHROMOSOME SIZE.


In directory Ctrl_from_50_HIP1_rich_genomes/ You will have the cooridnates for 
control motifs for the 50 cyanobacterial genomes analyzed in the paper.

Everything is in the same format as the HIP1-like motif.

Each line is space delimited.
