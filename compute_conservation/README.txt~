The Perl script compute_consv_SAK.pl will compute the motif conservation given a pair of genomes (the input of the script), which are pre-aligned in MAUVE

MAUVE is a whole genome alignment tool.


A sample input file (sample MAUVE output file) is given as syh_syg_gai.

MAUVE can be obtained following this URL:
