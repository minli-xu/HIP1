PERL SCRIPT: compute_consv_SAK.pl 

  computes the motif conservation score, given a whole genome
  alignment generated by MAUVE's progressive alignment fucntion.


The motif conservation is quantified by Jaccard score (i.e., the
fraction of elements in the union of two sets that also appear in
their intersection).  

Given aligned blocks, 

  n_A = number of motif sites in in aligned blocks in Genome A
  n_B = number of motif sites in in aligned blocks in Genome B
  n_AB = motif sites in Genome A that are perfectly aligned with the same motif in Genome_B 

Score:   n_AB / (n_A + n_B - n_AB)

INPUT:  

Pairwise alignments were constructed using the progressive alignment
function in MAUVE version 2.3.1 (35), using default parameter
settings.

A sample input file (sample MAUVE output file) is provided (syh_syg_gai).
